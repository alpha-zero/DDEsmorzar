			<p>The Serpent's Head campaign revolves around a group following an event in Esmorzar. A coincedental calling has grouped these players together leading them to Waverwen, known as the Serpent's Head, following suspicious events. Every character is somehow connected to the story, but what will this effect in their survival or to Waverwen's wellbeing as one of the strongest pillars of strength in Esmorzar?</p>
			<p>This is a supplements page made to house information known by the group for the players so that they can remember general keynotes of the story.</p>

					<p>The ruleset for this campaign is D&D 5e, but there are modifications made to accomodate both Orobos and my preferred DM playstyle.</p>

						<h2>Character Creation</h2>
						<h3>Races</h3>
						<p>Although more races exist available for you guys to choose from: Humans, elves, dwarves, dragonborn, half-elf, and halflings.</p>
						<p>I've added also included a little accompanying background information about how these races are treated during the current age in Esmorzar. For anything else you can refer to the main Orobos page.</p>
						<P>In case you want to random, I create a d20 roll chart.</p>
						<table style="min-width: 200px;">

							<h3>Human</h3>
							<p>The dominant and leading race in Esmorzar. Well scattered around the continent, Humanfolk tend to take lead in most issues in terms of government and overall military.</p>
							<h3>Elven</h3>
							<p>The third largest race in Esmorzar, slightly behind Dwarvekind. They established their roots into the Leylands and have large colonies and townships in the region. They are a secluded group and rarely stray outside the region.</p>
							<h3>Dragonborn</h3>
							<p>Unlike Paya and Catal in Orobos, the Dragonborn are treated more equally in comparison. Protected under the Draconian treaty, the Dragonborn established themselves as a working class race and proceed equally amongst the other races. Xenophobia towards Dragonborn of course still exists.</p>
							<h3>Dwarven</h3>
							<p>The well second largest race in Esmorzar, the dwarves established underground fortresses, and mining colonies across the continent. The largest being Mog Balthur in the Northern region of the Crawling Kingdom, and the sister cities Thragg and Thrull, in the Western Shatterlands and North Endling respectively.</p>
							<h3>Half-Elf</h3>
							<p>Uncommon and somewhat considered dirty from both Human and Elven kind as a crossbreed. They are seldom known to take home in the Leylands amongst the Elves.</p>
							<h3>Halfling</h3>
